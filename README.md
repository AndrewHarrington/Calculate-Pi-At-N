This is a Java implementation of a spigot algorithm that calculates Pi at digit "n". 

This is based off of the mathematical work of David H. Bailey, Peter Borwein, and Simon Plouffe using their Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula (BBP formula). 
More information about this formula can be found at en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe_formula

<i>This was built purely for fun. I did not write this math nor do I fully understand it but it was a fun challenge.</i>
